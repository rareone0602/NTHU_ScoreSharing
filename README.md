# NTHU_ScoreSharing

A browser extension that shares score distributions.  
You will be able to see score distributions of curriculums if anyone with this extension has it.  
In return, every class that you have taken will have its score distribution submitted to the shared database.  

## Remarks

The backend does not recieve any sensitive data of the users such as password and access token.  
Such processes are only done at the device of the user.
