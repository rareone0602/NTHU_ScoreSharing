# NTHU_ScoreSharing v0.904

A browser extension that shares score distributions.  
You will be able to see score distributions of curriculums if anyone with this extension has it.  
In return, every class that you have taken will have its score distribution submitted to the shared database.  

Available at chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nthuscoresharing/fbbgchnopppgncdjbckkjehfchncghdf  

## Remarks

The backend does not receive any sensitive data of the users such as password and access token.  
Procedures involving manipulation of sensitive data are only done at the device of the user. 

## Other Notes

This service is currently in alpha phase.  
Expect frequent updates, bug fixes, and perhaps failures due to our overloaded server.
